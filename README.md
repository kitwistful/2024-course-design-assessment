# Course Management System

You are asked to design a course management system. This system will help the faculty manage many courses, along with the enrolled students in each of the courses, and track their assignments.

## Notes on solution

I used pytest to unit test in this instance. The command I used was `pytest`.

To install, run `pip install -r requirements.txt".

When it comes to certain edge cases, e.g. student_id that does not exist, assignment that has not yet been submitted, I attempted to enforce some consistency. For example, attempting to pull data for an id that does not exist will generally throw a KeyError, while assignments that have recieved no assignments will render their grades/grade averages as being None.

## Requirements

This assessment has to be done in Python language.

You will find a service interface at `app/course_service.py`, please implement this service interface in file `app/course_service_impl.py`. All of the methods that are annotated by `@abstractmethod` must be implemented. The method comments would give you some basic clues about what these methods are expected to do.

Here are more details and requirements about this assessment:

-   The system will manage courses:
    -   Each course would have a name
    -   Each course could have an unlimited number of assignments
-   The system will be able to enroll students into courses:
    -   Each student could enroll an unlimited number of courses
-   The grade of a student's assignment will be an interger from 0 to 100, inclusive
-   Feel free to add any new files to the project as you need them
-   **_For simplicity, please do not use any external persistence for this assessment. Please choose the proper memory-based data structures you see fit for any data persistence need_**
-   Please also include unit tests to make sure your implementation is testable
-   Please feel free to ask any clarification questions

## Evaluation

The evaluation of this assessment will be mainly focusing on:

-   Software architectural design
-   Correctness of the solution (whether it meets the requirements)
-   Maintainability of the code
-   Readability of the code

In order to achieve excellence in these criteria, you can make reasonable assumptions,
or just ask us for any clarification questions.

## Submission

Please clone this repo and finish your implementation based on the requirements.

You can submit your assessment by either way:

-   Create a public GitHub repository and send us the URL for it
-   Zip your solution and email it back to us
